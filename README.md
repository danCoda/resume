# Dan's Simple Resume Website

This is a simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project (*'work in progress'*&trade;) to show a tiny sample of my coding ability. 

- Feel free to look around ðŸ™‚
- Let me know if you'd like to sample it.
- It is currently hosted on on Vercel. **You can view it [here](https://dan-son-resume.vercel.app/)**.

## Some cool NextJS features used in this project:

1. **Links** - Enable seamless navigation between pages, with preloading to ensure lightning quick user experiences. 
1. **Images** - Automatic optimised images for your device, for the best performance and quality. Also the images use the modern `avif` format in this project. 
1. **Fonts** - This project uses Google Fonts, and are preloaded onto the server. This ensures faster loading, consistent rendering and avoids [CLS](https://web.dev/articles/cls)
1. **Layouts** - Reusable layouts to maintain a consistent structure across pages.
1. **Root 404 Not Found Page** - Customised 404 error page to match your site's style vibe.
